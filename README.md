# Boolean-satifiability-problem
Implementation of Boolean ‫‪satisfiability‬‬ problem with Genetic Algorithm and Stochastic hill climbing.<br>
# Question explanation:
Boolean satisfiability problem is a NP-Complete problem where we are looking forward to find boolean values for boolean parameters that make an boolean expression true.<br>
One of many kinds of problem is 3-satisfiability that we work on.<br>
In 3-satisfiability boolean expressions are consist of a lot of subexpressions which every each one of that subexpressions is combination of 3 boolean variables in simple or opposite form like (X1 or Not(X1)). <br>
In this code problem we want to solve 3-satisfiability form of BSP. Inorder to do, we are going to implement two <b> Stochastic hill climbing <b> and <b>Genetic<b> Algorithms.<br>
